Human Relations Movement definition

The human relations movement was founded by sociologist
George Elton Mayo in the 1930s following a series of 
experiments known as the Hawthorne studies, which
focused on exploring the link between employee 
satisfaction/wellbeing and workplace productivity.

Essentially the Hawthorne studies concluded that when
employers take an interest in workers and make decisions
based on their natural needs and psychological makeup, 
productivity increases.They also found that people
work best when organised into groups, when they
can have effective two-way communication with their 
leaders, and when leaders communicate and share information
freely as part of an overall cohesive decision-making process.

The human relations movement is seen as the precursor of
the modern human resources function.
Before the human relations movement, workers were
typically seen as replaceable cogs in organisational
systems that put the ultimate value on higher output.
