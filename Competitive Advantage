A competitive advantage is an advantage over 
competitors gained by offering 
consumers greater value, either by means of 
lower prices or by providing
greater benefits and service that justifies 
higher prices.

Porter suggested four "generic" business strategies
that could be adopted in order to gain competitive
advantage. The strategies relate to
the extent to which the scope of a business'
activities are narrow versus
broad and the extent to which a business seeks
to differentiate its products.

Cost leadership
With this strategy, the objective is to become the lowest-cost 
producer in the industry. The traditional method to
achieve this objective is to produce on a
large scale which enables the business to exploit 
economies of scale.

Cost Focus
Here a business seeks a lower-cost advantage in just one 
or a small number of market segments.

The product will be basic - perhaps a similar product 
to the higher-priced and featured market leader, but
acceptable to sufficient consumers. Such products are 
often called "me-too's".

Differentiation focus
In the differentiation focus strategy, a business aims to 
differentiate within just one or a small number of
target market segments. The special customer needs
of the segment mean that there are opportunities to 
provide products that are clearly different from
competitors who may be targeting a broader group of 
customers.

Differentiation leadership
With differentiation leadership, the business targets 
much larger markets and aims to achieve competitive 
advantage across the whole of an industry.
This strategy involves selecting one or more 
criteria used by buyers in a market
- and then positioning the business uniquely to meet
those criteria. This strategy
is usually associated with charging a premium pricefor
the product - often to reflect 
the higher production costs and extra value-added 
features provided for the consumer.
