Strategic planning is a process undertaken by an organization to develop a plan for
achievement of its overall long-term organizational goals.

Strategic Planning Step 1: Gather inputs 
Successes and results from past strategic plans, environmental scans, and staff surveys
PESTLE: Outside of your business, there are many factors that affect how you can do
business, competitors being one, but also the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, 
Legal and Environmental climates that your organization or business operates in.

Strategic Planning Step 2: Vision
There's one thing to have a vision statement, and it's another to have a very clear
vision of the future, like a blueprint to a house. This is the foundation of your strategic plan.

Strategic Planning Step 3: Mission
This is an opportunity to focus your energy on a specific set of stakeholders (staff, 
shareholders, board, customers, etc). If you had to dedicate the majority of your resources 
to a group, who would it be? This is a tough question because the tendency is to say: "everyone".

Strategic Planning Step 4: Values
If you want to find the number one contributor to a successful organization, it's having
values that are understood and agreed on.

Strategic Planning Step 5: Competition, Risks and Road blocks
Strategic Priorities, Goal, Strategies and Tactics
This is where you can tie into the big picture thinking into action items as part
of your strategic planning process.

Strategic Planning Step 6: Communication Plan
This is where you'll make your plan as a team to communicate your strategic plan, 
and the things that you're going to get people bought in to your plan.

Strategic Planning Step 7: Action plan
Implementation is where most organizations falter, so a strong action plan is needed.
